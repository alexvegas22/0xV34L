For this first post, I&#39;d like to introduce myself and provide some context into my background.</p>

Using Linux

<p>My Linux journey started in the middle of highschool, when I first started using Tails as a way to be more private while browsing with Tor. As a first exposure to Linux, it was pretty positive and I didn&#39;t experience any friction trying to do the things I wanted to do.</p>
<p>
I, however, had no intention of daily driving a Linux distro since I was worried I wouldn&#39;t be able to play my favourite online games, so a full install would have to wait a couple of years.</p>
<ul>
<li>2020</li>
</ul>
<p>It wasnt until 2020 that I installed my first <em>real</em> distro : <strong>Ubuntu</strong>.
After the family 2009 iMac started slowing down significantly, I decided to boot Ubuntu on it to try to extend it&#39;s lifespan. This is also when I started learning about Linux at school, which further motivated me to start using it at home.</p>
<p>
I remember having a lot of trouble installing packages, being confused about why sometimes I had to install via the terminal, and other times by downloading app images from the web directly.</p>
